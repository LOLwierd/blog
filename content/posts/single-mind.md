I am reading (Kingdom)[https://mangareader.to/kingdom-10].

It is a historical manga based on a fictional story of a slave orphan during the era of warring states in China. Reading it I came to realise the protagonist is a single minded person. All he wants to do is become a great general.

People refer to him in the manga as single minded idiot.

Is that what is necessary to achieve one's goals? Single mindedness?
