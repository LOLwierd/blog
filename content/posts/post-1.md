I will be documenting whatever I fuck around with, whatever I learn here.

# Documenting.

I understand the importance of documenting. If I don't write down, document my thoughts, I will lose pretty and nuanced things to time.
Also my writing is getting worse and worse day by day. I hate that and this is an attempt to change it. 

Apart from technical computer sciency stuff, I will try to lay down my raw thoughts on some other subjects as well. 

Also I plan to maintain sort of a personal journal of things I am going through and feeling @ personal.lolwierd.ml (ofc no one can access it but me).

I also feel like this would be the best way to showcase my skills and what I learned.
 
Now all thats left to see is how long I keep this up ðŸ™‚.
