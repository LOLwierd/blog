How I get better?

If you have set a goal, and you miss it. How do you get better? Is it by hating yourself 'cause you missed it? Is it by not hating yourself and just moving forward?
Do you silently kee your failure at the back of your mind and keep hating yourself internally for missing it? How do you get better?

If you do not punish yourself for mistakes you made, how do you get better? How to learn? Do you take note of all the things you did wrong and be conscious all the time so
as to not repeat them? That sounds painful. Doing that would lead to forgetting other important things wouldn't it? It is a sloooww way to improve if it is any.

But is it the only way to improve? How about random walks. Like evoution. Try random shit. Just flap your hands around like you are drowing. I don't even know what this means
exactly. But basically torment yourself inside your head so as to trigger something whenever you are about to make the same mistake.

I try to do that. But is that the only way??? IDK.
